					<p>The Finance Minister recently announced various changes to Direct Tax while giving the details of the Economic Package. Various relaxations were given to the taxpayers in the form of extension of the statutory due dates, and reduction in the TDS and TCS rates. After the relaxations were announced by the FM people had several questions about the implications of such changes. We at CAclubindia attempted to help the taxpayers understand the implications of the same. We asked CA(CS) Ujjwal Jindal the answers to various queries that we had received from the taxpayers. Mr. Ujjwal is a first class commerce graduate (B.Com) from Delhi University, an associate Company Secretary (ICSI) and a practicing Chartered Accountant (U J & CO.). He has relevant experience in the field of direct and indirect tax laws, corporate, secretarial and allied laws, capital markets, etc. and is also the Co-founder at UJ LEGAL LLP. Here is what Mr. Ujjwal had to say about the changes introduced by FM in Direct Tax.</p>
